# Coding Conventions

This covers the basic coding conventions and guidelines for all C++ and Slang code that is submitted to this repository.

- It's expected that you will not love every convention that we've adopted.
- These conventions establish a modern C++17 style.
- Please keep in mind that it's impossible to make everybody happy all the time.
- Instead appreciate the consistency that these guidelines will bring to our code and thus improve the readability for others.

## General Guidelines

- Code is a medium for communication. When in doubt, favor code that is readable and maintainable.
- When in doubt, make your additions/edits fit in with the style of the code around it. It should not be possible to see where code switches from one programmer to another.
- In particular, resist the urge to _clean up_ code from other developers when doing an edit/merge, *even if* such cleanup brings the code more in line with the official style in this document. Seemingly innocent code cleanup can complicate subsequent merges by making diffs more complicated. Cleanup changes should be handled as separate edits and should take into account potential conflict with in-progress feature work.
- Follow the [error handling policy](./Error-Handling.md) described separately.

## Documentation and Comments

- When writing comments/documentation, remember that code could be read by a wide variety of people with different languages and cultures.
- Favor a simple and plain-spoken style over fancy words, langue-/culture-specific idioms, or pop-culture references.
- However, don't avoid technical terms when they are the correct and appropriate terms for what code is doing (e.g., *radiant flux* is a complex term, but it might be the right one).

## Files

- All files must start with the legal header (run `Tools/update_legal_headers.bat` to do this automatically).
- All files must end in blank line (use `.editorconfig` to enforce this).
- Folders, header and source files should be named with **PascalCase**. If applicable, the name should represent the type of the class defined in the file.

### Rules for C++ files

- Header files should have the extension `.h`
- Source files should have the extension `.cpp`
- Header files must include the preprocessor directive to only include a header file once:

```c++
#pragma once
```

- Source files should include the associated header in the first line of code after the commented license banner.
- Includes in source files should be arranged into groups ordered by:
  1. `stdafx.h` if precompiled headers are used (for example, inside Falcor)
  2. Matching header for the cpp file is first, if it exists.
  3. Other local includes from the same project.
  4. Other local includes from other projects (for example, includes from Falcor from a render pass).
  5. Other 3rd party includes.
  6. System headers.

### Rules for Slang files

- Slang files that are intended to be imported as modules should be named `.slang`
- Slang files that for some reason cannot be imported and must be included should be named `.slangh`
- Slang files that contain program entry points should include a suffix: `.rt.slang` for ray tracing, `.cs.slang` for compute, and `.3d.slang` for graphics programs (if the file has only a single shader stage, it is fine to name it according to that stage, for example `.ps.slang`). These suffices make it easier to find the entry points and prevent accidental `import` of a module that cannot be imported.
- Slang files should be placed alongside the host source files in the directory tree.
- Slang files that are included as headers (on the host or device) must include the preprocessor directive `#pragma once` to only include a header file once.
- Slang files that are imported as modules should _not_ include the preprocessor directive `#pragma once`.

## Namespaces

- Namespaces should be named with **PascalCase**.
- All code in the folder `Falcor` should be in namespace `Falcor`.
- Code in render pass DLLs should be in the global scope.
- `using namespace` is only allowed inside source files. It should never be used in header files.
- `using namespace std` is disallowed even in source files. If you want to save some work, alias the type you need from the std namespace, or use `auto`.
- Prefer anonymous namespaces to `static` functions and variables in `.cpp` files (`static` should be omitted inside anonymous namespaces).

## Naming Guidelines

- When there are multiple choices, favor US English spellings (e.g., `Color` instead of `Colour`, `Gray` instead of `Grey`). This isn't a value judgement, but we need a way for programmers to be able to predict how a function/type name will be spelled.
- Names that involve acronyms (e.g. NASA) or initialisms (e.g. BRDF, AABB) and which are conventionally written in all capitals in English, should be written either in all caps or all lowercase, depending on where they appear in a name, rather than force awkward capitalizations like `Brdf`.
- In extreme cases where multiple initialisms/acronyms must appear consecutively, it is okay to break with this convention for overall readability (so `XmlHttpRpc` instead of `XMLHTTPRPC`), but you probably shouldn't be giving things names like that anyway.
- Markers for dimensionality (e.g. `2D`, `3D`) are effectively initialisms (they are pronounced as such in English), as is the term `ID` when used to mean "identifier" or "identification" (as opposed to the company or pyschological concept of Id).
- Abbreviations should be applied consistently across type/function names: either a term is *always* abbreviated, or it *never* is.
- Specific terms that should always be abbreviated in type/function names:
    - `ID` for "identifier"
    - `Desc` for "description" or "descriptor" (in the sense of a value used to describe a thing to be constructed, but *not* in the case of a resource/binding "descriptor" in Vulkan/D3D12).
    - `Ptr` for "pointer"
- The following names cannot be used according to the [C++ standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/identifiers):
    - Names that are already keywords
    - Names with a double underscore anywhere are reserved
    - Names that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved
    - Names that begin with an underscore are reserved in the global namespace.
- Method names must always begin with a verb, this avoids confusion about what a method actually does:

```c++
someVector.getLength();
someObject.applyForce(x, y, z);
someObject.isDynamic();
someTexture.getFormat();
```

- The terms get/set or is/set (*bool*) should be used where an attribute is accessed directly. This indicates there is no significant computation overhead and only access:

```c++
mesh.getName();
mesh.setName("Bunny");
light.isEnabled();
light.setEnabled(true);
```

- Use stateful names for all boolean variables (`enabled`, `initialized`) and leave questions for methods (`isEnabled()` and `isInitialized()`)

```c++
bool isEnabled() const;
void setEnabled(bool enabled);

void doSomething()
{
    bool initialized = mSomeSystem.isInitialized();
    ...
}
```

- Please consult the [antonym list](https://gist.github.com/maxtruxa/b2ca551e42d3aead2b3d) if naming symmetric functions.
- Avoid redundancy in naming methods and functions. The name of the object is implicit, and must be avoided in method names:

```c++
line.getLength(); // NOT: line.getLineLength();
```

- Prefer function names that indicate when a method does significant work:

```c++
float waveHeight = wave.computeHeight(); // NOT: wave.getHeight();
```

- Avoid public method, arguments and member names that are likely to have been defined in the preprocessor, when in doubt, use another name or prefix it:

```c++
size_t malloc; // BAD
size_t bufferMalloc; // GOOD
int min, max; // BAD
int boundsMin, boundsMax; // GOOD
```

- Avoid conjunctions and sentences in names as much as possible:

```c++
bool skipIfDataIsCached; // BAD
bool skipCachedData; // GOOD
```

- Use `Count` at the end of a name for the number of items:

```c++
size_t numberOfShaders; // BAD
size_t shaderCount; // GOOD
```

## Name Prefixing and Casing

The following table outlines the naming prefixing and casing used:

|Construct| Prefixing / Casing|
| --- | --- |
| class, struct, enum class and typedef | `PascalCase` |
| constants | `kCamelCase` |
| enum class values | `PascalCase` |
| functions | `camelCase` |
| public member variables | `camelCase` |
| private/protected member variables | `mCamelCase` |
| private/protected static member variables | `sCamelCase` |
| global - static variable at file or project scope | `gCamelCase` |
| local variables | `camelCase` |
| macros | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` |

In addition `p` prefix is used for pointers. This applies to all kinds of variables, e.g. `mpSomePtr`, `spSomePointer` etc.

### Variables

- Names should in general be descriptive of what a variable/parameter/etc. represents.
- The shorter the scope of a variable, the less important it is for it to have a verbose and descriptive name. Single-letter names are okay for extremely short-lived variables and loop counters, so long as their role is clear in context.

### Macros

- The use of macros should be minimized.
- Global macros should be prefixed with `FALCOR_` to avoid collisions.
- Arguments in macros should be prefixed with an `_` to avoid collisions.


## Language

- Use `using` declaration instead of `typedef` (e.g. `using IndexVector = std::vector<uint32_t>;`).
- Use sized types such as `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `int16_t`. Conceptually, `bool` has unknown size, so no size equivalent. `char` is special and can be used only for C strings (use `int8_t` otherwise).
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0`.
- Use `enum class` instead of `enum`.

### Rules for C++ classes/interfaces

- Classes with shared ownership:
    - Must define a `SharedPtr` (e.g. `using SharedPtr = std::shared_ptr<MyClass>;`).
    - Must expose a `SharedPtr create(...);` function. All constructors must be private/protected.
- Passing arguments:
    - Use a (const) reference or raw-pointer if the argument is used only during the function's lifetime (i.e. the function doesn't store it in a member variable for future use).
    - Use `const SomeObject::SharedPtr&` if the called function takes ownership of the object (i.e. store it in a member variable for future use). We use a const reference to avoid incrementing the reference count.
- Prefer using `std::shared_ptr` over `std::unique_ptr`. Not to say that you can't use `std::unique_ptr`, but if you do you better have a good reason to do so.
- Use the `override` specifier on all overridden virtual methods. It helps catch bugs.
- Avoid using `friend` unless absolutely needed.

### Rules for C++ structs

- Structs are primarily used as data containers without member functions.
- All fields must be public.
- Variable initializers are allowed.

### Rules for Slang code

- The formatting and naming guidelines are identical to C++.
- Structs are used as data and code containers (there are no classes).
- Prefer member functions over global functions.
- Prefer enums instead of using macros or global constants.
- All entry points for a ray tracing or graphics program should be defined in the same file.


## Code Formatting

- You should set your Editor/IDE to follow the formatting guidelines.
- This repository uses `.editorconfig`, take advantage of it.

### Indentation

- Use **4 spaces**, no tabs.
- Indent next line after all braces `{` `}`.
- Move code after braces `{` `}` to the next line.
- Always indent the next line of any condition statement line:

```c++
if (box.isEmpty())
{
    return;
}
```

```c++
for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i)
{
    if (distance(sphere, points[i]) > sphere.radius)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```
- Single line statements without braces are OK in rare cases:

```c++
if (box.isEmpty()) return;
```

### Spacing

- Function call spacing:
    - No space before bracket.
    - No space just inside brackets.
    - One space after each comma separating parameters.

```c++
serializer->writeFloat("range", range);
```

- Conditional statement spacing:
    - One space after conditional keywords.
    - No space just inside the brackets.
    - One space separating commas, colons and condition comparison operators.

```c++
if (light.getIntensity() > 0.f)
{
    switch (light.getType())
    {
        case Light::Type::Directional:
            ...
```

- Align indentation space for parameters when wrapping lines to match the initial bracket:

```c++
Matrix::Matrix(float m11, float m12, float m13, float m14,
               float m21, float m22, float m23, float m24,
               float m31, float m32, float m33, float m34,
               float m41, float m42, float m43, float m44)
```

```c++
return sqrt((point.x - sphere.center.x) * (point.x - sphere.center.x) +
            (point.y - sphere.center.y) * (point.y - sphere.center.x) +
            (point.z - sphere.center.z) * (point.z - sphere.center.x));
```

### Comments

- Use the following syntax for adding comments to functions:

```c++
/** Colorize a string for writing to a terminal.
    \param[in] str String to colorize
    \param[in] color Color
    \return Returns string wrapped in color codes.
*/
```

- Use `\param[in]`, `\param[out]` and `\param[in,out]` to specify how the function uses the arguments.
- Use `//` for inline comments:

```c++
// Find next empty slot.
auto it = find_if(list.begin(), list.end(), [] (const Slot& slot) { return slot.isEmpty(); });
```

- Use `///<` for commenting struct fields:

```c++
struct Info
{
    float distance; ///< Distance to nearest point.
    uint32_t index; ///< Index of nearest point.
};
```

- Avoid block comments `/* */` inside implementation code (`.cpp`).

### Logging

- Use single quotes for quoting names in log output:

```c++
logWarning("'{}' is not a valid name.", name);
```
