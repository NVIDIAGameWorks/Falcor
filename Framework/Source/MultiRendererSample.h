    /** A more complex "Sample" that handles virtually all window / GUI stuff internally, so writing a prototype
        is as simple as creating a derived Renderer class (see Renderer/Renderer.h) that defines initialization
        and rendering callbacks (and optionally a handful of other callback).  You can then swap between
        different prototype renderers via a dropdown in the GUI and (ideally) the MultiRendererSample
        encapsulates state (pushes/pops/cleans) so that even buggy prototypes don't screw up code running in
        other Renderers.  (It's also easy to do side-by-side comparisons:  just write a Renderer that takes
        in two other Renderers and displays them side by side.)

        Adds a "Load Scene" button / function that loads Falcor scene files for you.

        There are two methods users of MultiRendererSample object may need: addRenderer() and loadScene().
