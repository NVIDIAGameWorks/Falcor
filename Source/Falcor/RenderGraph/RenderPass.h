        Render passes are expected to implement a static create() function that returns
        a shared pointer to a new object, or throws an exception if creation failed.
        The constructor should be private to force creation of shared pointers.

        Render passes are inserted in a render graph, which is executed at runtime.
        Each render pass declares its I/O requirements in the reflect() function,
        and as part of the render graph compilation their compile() function is called.
        At runtime, execute() is called each frame to generate the pass outputs.
