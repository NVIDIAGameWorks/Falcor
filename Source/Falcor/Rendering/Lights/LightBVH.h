        This is binary BVH over all emissive triangles as described by Moreau and Clarberg,
        "Importance Sampling of Many Lights on the GPU", Ray Tracing Gems, Ch. 18, 2019.

        Before being used, the BVH needs to have been built using LightBVHBuilder::build().
        The data can be both used on the CPU (using traverseBVH() or on the GPU by:
          1. import LightBVH;
          2. Declare a variable of type LightBVH in your shader.
          3. Call setShaderData() to bind the BVH resources.

        TODO: Rename all things 'triangle' to 'light' as the BVH can be used for other light types.
