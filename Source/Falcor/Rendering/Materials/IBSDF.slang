/** Interface for a bidirection scattering distribution function (BSDF).

    The term BSDF is used here in a broad sense for the mathematical function which
    describes the scattering of light at a shading location.

    This interface allows evaluation and sampling of the BSDF, and associated functionality.
    Implementations of the interface has all material properties evaluated at the shading location.
    BSDF instances are created and initialized by the corresponding material.
   
    The shading location and its attributes are described by a ShadingData struct.
    The ShadingData view direction field specifies the direction from which the
    shading location is seen. By convention we call this the incident direction (wi).
    The outgoing direction (wo) is the direction in which the transported quantity
    (radiance or importance) is scattered in.

    Conventions:
     - The incident and outgoing direction point away from the shading location.
     - The incident direction (wi) is given by ShadingData.
     - The outgoing direction (wo) is sampled.
     - The foreshortening term with respect to the sampled direction is always included.

    Note:
     - The [anyValueSize(n)] attribute specifies the maximum size in bytes an implementation type
       to IBSDF can be. Slang compiler will check the implementation types and emits an error
       if an implementation exceeds this size.
     - The maximum size can be increased if needed, but it should be kept as small as possible
       to reduce register pressure in case the compiler fails to optimize.
