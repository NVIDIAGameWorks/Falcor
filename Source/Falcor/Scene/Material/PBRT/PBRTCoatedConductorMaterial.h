    /** This class implements a coated conductor material, i.e. a
        dielectric coating on top of a conductor base. Both conductor
        and coating can be smooth or rough, isotropic or anisotropic.
        The material simulates interreflection between the layers
        using a Monte Carlo random walk.

        This class perfectly matches the PBRT "coatedconductor" material.

        Texture channel layout:

            BaseColor
                - RGB - Conductor complex Eta
                - A   - Opacity
            Transmission
                - RGB - Conductor complex k
            Specular
                - R - Interface X Roughness
                - G - Interface Y Roughness
                - B - Conductor X Roughness
                - A - Conductor Y Roughness
            Normal
                - 3-Channel standard normal map, or 2-Channel BC5 format

        See additional texture channels defined in BasicMaterial.
