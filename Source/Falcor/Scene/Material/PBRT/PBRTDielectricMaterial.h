    /** This class implements a dielectric material. This means the
        surface has both (uncolored) reflection and refraction lobes.
        The material can be act like an ideal smooth surface
        (if roughness is 0), or a (potentially anisotropic) GGX microfacet.

        This class perfectly matches the PBRT "dielectric" material.

        Texture channel layout:

            Specular
                - R - X Roughness
                - G - Y Roughness
                - B - Unused
                - A - Unused
            Normal
                - 3-Channel standard normal map, or 2-Channel BC5 format

        See additional texture channels defined in BasicMaterial.
