    /** SDF grid base class, stored by distance values at grid cell/voxel corners.
        The local space of the SDF grid is [-0.5, 0.5]^3 meaning that initial distances used to create the SDF grid should be within the range of [-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)].

        SDF grid implementations create AABBs that should be used as procedural primitives to create acceleration structures.
        SDF grids can currently not be rendered using rasterization.
        Instead, SDF grids must be built into an acceleration structure and may then be ray traced using an intersection shader or inline intersection test.

        There are four different SDF grid implementations:
        1.  The "Normalized Dense Grid" (NDSDFGrid) creates a dense hierarchy of volume textures (they are not mip-levels as they are all have widths of (2^l) - 1.
            Values stored in these volume textures are normalized to be in the range [-1, 1] where 1 represents whatever narrow band thickness is chosen half voxel diagonals.
            For example: Using a narrow band thickness of 3, a value of 1 in the NDSDFGrid will represent a grid distance of 1.5 voxel diagonals.

        2.  The "SDF Sparse Voxel Set" (SDFSVS) creates a sparse set of voxels. Only voxels that overlap the implicit surface formed from the SDF are instantiated.
            The SDFSVS then creates AABBs for all of these voxels, this buffer of AABBs is suitable for use as procedural geometry when creating a BLAS.
            Distance values in the SDFSVS are normalized to the range [-1, 1] so that a value of 1 represents half of a voxel diagonal.

        3.  The "SDF Sparse Brick Set" (SDFSBS) creates a sparse set of NxNxN bricks, where N can be any number of voxels. Each brick is therefore a dense collection
            of voxels with normalized distances at corners. The distances are normalized to the range [-1, 1] so that a value of 1 represents half of a voxel diagonal.
            If (N+1) is a multiple of 4 then lossy compression can be enabled for the SDFSBS.

        4.  The "SDF Sparse Voxel Octree" (SDFSVO) creates a sparse set of voxels and construct an octree out of them. It is then possible to build a BLAS
            out the AABB buffer constructed by the SDFSVO. This can then be used to intersect rays against the SDFSVO.
            Distances stored in the voxels of the octree are normalized to the range [-1, 1] so that a value of 1 represents half of a voxel diagonal.
