/** This struct holds information needed for shading a hit point.

    This includes:
    - Geometric properties of the surface.
    - Texture coordinates.
    - Material ID and header.
    - Opacity value for alpha testing.
    - Index of refraction of the surrounding medium.

    Based on a ShadingData struct, the material system can be queried
    for a BSDF instance at the hit using `gScene.materials.getBSDF()`.
    The BSDF has interfaces for sampling and evaluation, as well as for
    querying its properties at the hit.
