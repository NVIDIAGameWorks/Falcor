        This sort method is efficient for sorting shorter sequences.
        The time complexity is O(N*log^2(N)), but it parallelizes very well and has practically no branching.
        The sort is implemented using horizontal operations within warps, and shared memory across warps.

        This code requires an NVIDIA GPU and NVAPI. Set FALCOR_ENABLE_NVAPI to true in FalcorConfig.h.
