     * Perform parallel reduction.
     * The computations are performed in type T, which must be compatible with the texture format:
     * - float4 for floating-point texture formats (float, snorm, unorm).
     * - uint4 for unsigned integer texture formats.
     * - int4 for signed integer texture formats.
     *
     * For the Sum operation, unused components are set to zero if texture format has < 4 components.
     *
     * For performance reasons, it is advisable to store the result in a buffer on the GPU,
     * and then issue an asynchronous readback in user code to avoid a full GPU flush.
     *
     * The size of the result buffer depends on the executed operation:
     * - Sum needs 16B
     * - MinMax needs 32B
     *
     * @param[in] pRenderContext The render context.
     * @param[in] pInput Input texture.
     * @param[in] operation Reduction operation.
     * @param[out] pResult (Optional) The result of the reduction operation is stored here if non-nullptr. Note that this requires a GPU
     * flush!
     * @param[out] pResultBuffer (Optional) Buffer on the GPU to which the result is copied (16B or 32B).
     * @param[out] resultOffset (Optional) Byte offset into pResultBuffer to where the result should be stored.
