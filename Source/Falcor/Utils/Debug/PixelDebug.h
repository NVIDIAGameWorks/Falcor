    /** Helper class for shader debugging using print() and assert().

        Host-side integration:
         - Create PixelDebug object
         - Call beginFrame()/endFrame() before and after executing programs with debugging.
         - Call prepareProgram() before launching a program to use debugging.
         - Call onMouseEvent() and renderUI() from the respective callbacks in the render pass.

        Runtime usage:
         - Import PixelDebug.slang in your shader.
         - Use printSetPixel() in the shader to set the current pixel.
         - Use print() in the shader to output values for the selected pixel.
           All basic types (e.g. bool, int3, float2, uint4) are supported.
         - Click the left mouse button (or edit the coords) to select a pixel.
         - Use assert() in the shader to test a condition for being true.
           All pixels are tested, and failed asserts logged. The coordinates
           of asserts that trigger can be used with print() to debug further.

        The shader code is disabled (using macros) when debugging is off.
        When enabled, async readback is used but expect a minor perf loss.
