// numbers with a given distribution," IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 17(9), 972-975.
//
// Basic idea:  creating each alias table entry combines one overweighted sample and one underweighted sample
// into one alias table entry plus a residual sample (the overweighted sample minus some of its weight).
//
// By first separating all inputs into 2 temporary buffer (one overweighted set, with weights above the
// average; one underweighted set, with weights below average), we can simply walk through the lists once,
// merging the first elements in each temporary buffer.  The residual sample is interted into either the
// overweighted or underweighted set, depending on its residual weight.
//
// The main complexity is dealing with corner cases, thanks to numerical precision issues, where you don't
// have 2 valid entries to combine.  By definition, in these corner cases, all remaining unhandled samples
// actually have the average weight (within numerical precision limits)
