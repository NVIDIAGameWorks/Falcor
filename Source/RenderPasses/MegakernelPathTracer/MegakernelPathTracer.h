/** Forward path tracer using a megakernel in DXR 1.0.

    The path tracer has a loop over the path vertices in the raygen shader.
    The kernel terminates when all paths have terminated.

    This pass implements a forward path tracer with next-event estimation,
    Russian roulette, and multiple importance sampling (MIS) with sampling
    of BRDFs and light sources.
