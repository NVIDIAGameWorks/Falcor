/** Minimal path tracer.

    This pass implements a minimal brute-force path tracer. It does purposely
    not use any importance sampling or other variance reduction techniques.
    The output is unbiased/consistent ground truth images, against which other
    renderers can be validated.

    Note that transmission and nested dielectrics are not yet supported.
