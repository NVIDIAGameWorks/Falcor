# Ninja can fail when embedding manifests just after building an executable or library.
# mt.exe may not be able to open the file because AV software has already locked it.
# msbuild presumably has some retry mechanism in place to deal with this, but when
# building with Ninja this problem can still emerge.
# To fix this, we set CMAKE_MT to execute a wrapper batch script which does re-run
# mt.exe in case it fails the first time.
