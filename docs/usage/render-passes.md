# Render Passes

Note: This page will cover more complex elements of render passes. Basic elements are covered in the tutorial [here](../tutorials/02-implementing-a-render-pass.md).

## Registering classes

Falcor will look for a function called `registerPlugin()` in your shared library. The signature is as follows:

```c++
extern "C" FALCOR_API_EXPORT void registerPlugin(Falcor::PluginRegistry& registry);
```

This function should register all the render pass classes that the library exports:

```c++
extern "C" FALCOR_API_EXPORT void registerPlugin(Falcor::PluginRegistry& registry)
{
    registry.registerClass<RenderPass, ExamplePass>();
}
```

Generally, `registerPlugin()` will reside in the same source file as the render pass it exports. For libraries that export multiple passes, this function should be located in a separate source file that shares a name with the project (e.g. a library named `Antialiasing` that contains some number of render passes should contain these functions within the source file `Antialiasing.cpp`).

## Render Pass Resource Allocation and Lifetime

By default, every output and temporary resource is allocated by the render-graph. Input resources are never allocated specifically for the pass.
Input resources must be satisfied by either an edge in the graph or an resource bound directly to the graph by the user.

A resource can be marked with the `Field::Flags::Optional` bit. This flag only makes sense for input and output resources. Using this field on an internal resource is a good way to ensure it will not be allocated.
For input resources, this flag means that the pass can execute even if this input is not satisfied.
If this flag is set on an output resource, it will only be allocated if it is required by a graph edge.

Using the `Field::Flags::Persistent` bit on a resource tells to graph system that the resource needs to retain it's data between calls to `RenderPass::execute()`. This effectively disables all resource-allocation optimizations the render-graph performs for the current resource.
* *Note that this flag doesn't ensure persistence across graph re-compilation. Re-compilation will most certainly reset the resources.*

As a final note, you should not cache resources inside your pass. This will interfere with the render-graph allocator and will probably result in rendering errors.

## Passing Data Between Passes

### Render Data

Each render pass specifies which input/outputs it needs. These are then available in the pass' `execute()` function via `pRenderData->getTexture()`.

### Other Data

Other data than render data can be passed between passes via a `InternalDictionary` accessible in `execute()` via `pRenderData->getDictionary()`.

The `InternalDictionary` is a shared resource, that all passes can read/write to by. The data stored in it is persistent between frames, but not across render graph re-compilation.

Pass A:
```
float x = 5.0f
InternalDictionary& dict = pRenderData->getDictionary();
dict["foo"] = x;    // stores float value for key 'foo'
```

Pass B:
```
InternalDictionary& dict = pRenderData->getDictionary();
float x = dict["foo"];    // load float value from key 'foo'
```

If a key doesn't exist when trying to load it, an error is logged. The function `keyExists()` can be used to check if a key exists before loading it.

## Serializing Passes

### Loading a pass

The `create()` method you are required to provide accepts a `Dictionary` object. This is essentially a map with Python bindings, where the key is a string and the value can be any object.

The render-graph importer will parse and pass that dictionary into the `create()` of the render-pass.

The pass is responsible for initializing its members based on key/value pairs found in the `Dictionary`.

Casting a value in the dictionary to another type upon loading it fails in some cases. This is also an error. For such types, load into a temporary variable before casting in a separate step:
```
float tmp = dict["foo"];
mytype x = (mytype)tmp;
```

### Saving a pass

The render-graph exporter will call the virtual `getScriptingDictionary()`. Use this function to serialize your pass, like so:

```c++
const char* kFilter = "filter"
Dictionary ExamplePass::getScriptingDictionary() const
{
    Dictionary dict;
    dict[kFilter] = mFilter;
    return dict;
}
```

You will probably need to make some changes to the script bindings, even in cases where you did not declare new classes or enums. See below.

## Script Bindings

In order to use your pass with Python scripting, you will need to register it as well as any associated classes, functions, enums, and properties with pybind11. This is done like so:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    // register classes, properties, and enums here
}

extern "C" FALCOR_API_EXPORT void registerPlugin(Falcor::PluginRegistry& registry)
{
    registry.registerClass<RenderPass, ExamplePass>();
    ScriptBindings::registerBinding(regExamplePass);
}
```

### Registering Classes

If you plan to expose properties or functions associated with your render pass, you have to register the render pass class with the scripting module:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    pybind11::class_<ExamplePass, RenderPass, ExamplePass::SharedPtr> pass(m, "ExamplePass");
    ...
}
```

With this we specify that `ExamplePass` inherits from `RenderPass` and uses `ExamplePass::SharedPtr` as a holder type (Falcor uses shared pointers for managing resources).

If you have other classes you wish to register with the scripting module:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    pybind11::class_<SomeClass> someClass(m, "SomeClass");
    ...
}
```

### Registering Properties

If you want to expose properties to Python scripting:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    pybind11::class_<ExamplePass, RenderPass, ExamplePass::SharedPtr> pass(m, "ExamplePass");
    pass.def_property("property", &SomeClass::getProperty, &SomeClass::setProperty);
    pass.def_property_readonly("readOnlyProperty", &SomeClass::getReadOnlyProperty);
}
```

This allows you to access the bound properties of your pass or other classes the same way you would access properties for any given instance of a Python class.

### Registering Methods

If you want to expose methods to Python scripting:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    pybind11::class_<ExamplePass, RenderPass, ExamplePass::SharedPtr> pass(m, "ExamplePass");
    pass.def("foo", &ExamplePass::foo); // simple function registration
    pass.def("bar", &ExamplePass::bar, "someArg"_a = 1); // function with a named/default argument
    pass.def("baz", pybind11::overload_cast<uint32_t>(&ExamplePass::baz));
    pass.def("baz", pybind11::overload_cast<>(&ExamplePass::baz); // overloaded functions
}
```

Some things to note:
- The `""_a` operator takes the provided string and converts it to a `pybind11::arg` with that name.
- `pybind11::overload_cast<>()` takes as template parameters the types of the arguments to the overloaded function being bound. For example, the first binding for `ExamplePass::baz` binds the overload that accepts a `uint32_t`, whereas the second binding binds the overload that takes no arguments.

### Registering Enums

If you have enums you wish to register:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    pybind11::enum_<SomeClass::EnumClass> e(m, "SomeClassEnumClass");
    e.value("Foo", SomeClass::EnumClass::Foo);
    e.value("Bar", SomeClass::EnumClass::Bar);
}
```

Note that enum values cannot be reserved keywords in Python. Names like `None`, `True`, `False` etc. are therefore not allowed. If your enum has values with those names, register them with a different names.

If the enum is used as a set of flags, you can use the `Falcor::ScriptBindings::addEnumBinaryOperators(enum)` helper to register binary operators on the enum type.

When registering the enum, include the class name as part of the enum name. This is a workaround for the fact that Python doesn't include the class name, and we risk getting name clashes if an enum type with the same name exists in different classes.

The convention is that the C++ enum `MyClass::Type` should be registered as `MyClassType`. For example:

`pybind11::enum_<MyClass::Type> e(m, "MyClassType");`

**Note:**
You might be tempted to convert enums to and from `uint`. Don't do that, it can result in a backward compatibility issue. Consider this a fast and dirty solution and only use it during pass bringup.

### Registering Serializable Structs

If you want to expose data structs that can be serialized into Python dictionaries (i.e. for storing options to configure a render pass), you can use the `Falcor::ScriptBindings::SerializableStruct` helper. Lets assume we have a struct as follows:

```c++
struct SomeOptions
{
    float foo;
    int bar;
    std::string str;
}
```

This struct can be exposed to Python using:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    ScriptBindings::SerializableStruct<SomeOptions> someOptions(m, "SomeOptions");
    someOptions.field("foo", &SomeOptions::foo);
    someOptions.field("bar", &SomeOptions::bar);
    someOptions.field("str", &SomeOptions::str);
}
```

Using a local macro we can get rid of some of the repetitive typing:

```c++
static void regExamplePass(pybind11::module& m)
{
    ScriptBindings::SerializableStruct<SomeOptions> someOptions(m, "SomeOptions");
#define field(f_) field(#f_, &SomeOptions::f_)
        someOptions.field(foo);
        someOptions.field(bar);
        someOptions.field(str);
#undef field
}
```
